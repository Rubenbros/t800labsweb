  "FAQ": {
    "q1": "How much does a website for my business cost?",
    "a1": "It depends on what you need. A professional website with your own domain starts from €1,500. Online bookings, e-commerce or extra features are quoted separately. I'll give you a fixed quote with no obligation after understanding your case.",
    "q2": "How long does it take to be ready?",
    "a2": "A professional website can be ready in 2-4 weeks. More complex projects (online store, booking app) take 1-3 months. I show you progress every week so you can see how it's going.",
    "q3": "Do I need to know about technology to have a website?",
    "a3": "Not at all. I handle everything technical. You just tell me what your business needs and I translate it into a digital solution. Plus, I teach you to manage your site with a simple admin panel.",
    "q4": "Can I update the website myself afterwards?",
    "a4": "Yes. All websites include an easy admin panel where you can change texts, photos, prices and hours without touching code. And if you need help, I'm here.",
    "q5": "What if I don't have a logo, photos or copy?",
    "a5": "Don't worry, it's more common than you think. I can guide you with logo design, use professional stock photography and write your website copy. All included in the project.",
    "q6": "How much does monthly maintenance cost?",
    "a6": "Hosting and domain cost €10-30/month depending on the project. Technical maintenance (updates, security, backups) starts from €50/month. Many clients don't need ongoing maintenance.",
    "q7": "Do you work remotely or only in person?",
    "a7": "I work with clients anywhere in the world. The process is 100% digital: video calls, online deliveries and smooth communication via WhatsApp or email. No matter where you are.",
    "q8": "What's this AI thing? Is it useful for my business?",
    "a8": "AI can automate repetitive tasks in your business: answer common questions, send appointment reminders, manage inventory, generate social media content... If something takes up your time every day, AI can probably do it for you."
